# Discord-Gif-Scraper
A script for saving all of the gifs favorited on Discord.
By default this script works based on Linux directories, but all you'd need to do to make it work with Windows is to change on line.

As of right now this script is not multi-threaded.

In all honesty it's probably sloppy as hell too.
But here it is, enjoy.
