# Discord-Gif-Scraper
A script for saving all of the gifs favorited on Discord.
By default this script works based on Linux directories. I'm sure it's not difficult to convert for Windows usage.

As of right now this script is not multi-threaded.

In all honesty it's probably sloppy as hell too.
But here it is, enjoy.
